NAME
kern-bld.sh - build a kernel
SYNOPSIS
kern-bld.sh [OPTIONS] kerneldirectory
DESCRIPTION
This script will build a new, from scratch, kernel or update an existing kernel.
Run with the appropriate privileges it can also install the kernel. The two
directory parameters, which can be persisted, should point to the location of
the source and the location of the parallel build target. The kerneldirectory
specified on the command line is then appended to these paths. The config file
option, which can be persisted, should point to an existing kernel config file
which will be copied to the output directory.

When building a new kernel the following tasks are performed:-

a) make distclean is run.

b) a specified kernel config file is copied in as .config

c) make menuconfig is run so changes to the config can be made

d) lsmod is run ignoring Virtualbox modules, the output is then used in

e) make localmodconfig is run using the above lsmod output

f) the temporary lsmod input file is removed

g) make -j4 is run

When updating a kernel only make -j4 is run.

OPTIONS
-c, --config-file full path to the kernel config file to be copied in. Only

-h, --help prints usage information

-i, --install install the kernel and kernel modules

-n, --new build a new kernel from scratch using a new copy of the .config file

-o, --output-dir specify a build output directory

-p, --persist save the --output-dir, --source-dir and --config-file values for
future defaults

-s, --source-dir specify a source directory

-u, --update update a previously built kernel

-V, --version prints version information

66 - File access error

67 - trap received

77 - Permissions error

EXAMPLE
kern-bld.sh -ups /home/mg/kernel/source -o /home/mg/kernel/build stable

will build a kernel from source located in /home/mg/kernel/source/stable putting
the built objects in /home/mg/kernel/build/stable. It will also store the 2
parameters to use as defaults.

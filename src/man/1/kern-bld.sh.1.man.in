NAME
kern-bld.sh - build a kernel
SYNOPSIS
kern-bld.sh [OPTIONS] kerneldirectory
DESCRIPTION
This script will build a kernel with a new config file copied from an existing
file, (usually a distro config file), or build a kernel with the in-place config
file.
.br
Run with the appropriate privileges it can also install the kernel. The two
directory parameters, which can be persisted, should point to the location of
the source and the location of the parallel build target. The kerneldirectory
specified on the command line is then appended to these paths. The config file
option, which can be persisted, should point to an existing kernel config file
which will be copied to the output directory.

When building a kernel with the -n --new option, the following tasks are
performed:-

a) make distclean is run

b) a specified kernel config file is copied in as .config

c) lsmod is run, the output is then used in

d) make localmodconfig is run using the above lsmod output

e) the temporary lsmod input file is removed

then for both -n --new and -u --update options the following steps are
performed:-

1) make olddefconfig is run

2) make menuconfig is run so changes to the config can be made

3) make prepare is run

4) make -jX is run where X is the concurrency parameter or -j --jobs value

OPTIONS
-c, --config-file full path to the kernel config file to be copied in. Only
valid with -n option, not -u

-h, --help prints usage information

-i, --install install the kernel and kernel modules

-j, --jobs the number of parallel processes to use in the build

-n, --new build a kernel using a new copy of the .config file

-o, --output-dir specify a build output directory

-p, --persist save the --output-dir, --source-dir, --jobs and --config-file
values for future defaults

-s, --source-dir specify a source directory

-u, --update build a kernel using the in-place config file

-V, --version prints version information
EXIT STATUS
0 - Success

EXAMPLE
kern-bld.sh -ups /home/mg/kernel/source -o /home/mg/kernel/build stable

will build a kernel from source located in /home/mg/kernel/source/stable putting
the built objects in /home/mg/kernel/build/stable. It will also store the 2
parameters to use as defaults.
